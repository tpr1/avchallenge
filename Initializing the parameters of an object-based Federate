# This guide describes how we to add and initialize custom parameters to an object-based federate.

The Simple Adder project (https://github.com/usnistgov/ucef-samples/tree/develop/SimpleAdder) already implements the methods we describe here and we're leveraging it to bring the same methods to the AV project.

Let's pick the ABS federate as an example to implement custom parameters initialization:  

The CAN object within this federate has parameters set to null by default: (ie : )

We can either assign values to these parameters in the ABS.java file itself, which might clutter our code and won't be practical for the long run.

The best method is to use or using configuration files.

1) ABSConfig.java 

Contains the ABSConfig Class which extends from FederateConfig class.

ach configuration parameter must be declared as a public member variable annotated with the following annotation : 

@FederateParameter.
 * 
 * See {@link InputSource#main(String[])} and {@link InputSource#InputSource(InputSourceConfig)} for how to use the
 * configuration class to initialize a federate.
 */
public class ABSConfig extends FederateConfig {
    /**
     * ABS Measured Wheel Speed.
     */
	@FederateParameter
    public String placeholder;
    @FederateParameter
    public double ST;
    @FederateParameter
    public String Wheel_Speed;
